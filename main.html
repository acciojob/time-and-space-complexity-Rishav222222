	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to execute as a function of its input size, and it is the efficient way.</p>
	<p>O(n) represents linear <b>space complexity</b>, where the memory usage grows linearly with the input size. </p>
