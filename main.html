	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>ime complexity is a concept in computer science that deals with the efficiency of algorithms. In particular, time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, as a function of the size of the input to the program.</p>
	<p>The <b>Space Complexity</b> of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space or memory taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It's represented by O(n) where n is the input size. </p>
